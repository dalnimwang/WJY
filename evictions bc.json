This landlord abuse nearly destroyed our lives. And when we did seek some recompense through the tenancy branch, the landlord called in her relatives and privileged friends to lie about our move out date to get the case thrown out claiming the statute for filing a dispute had passed. I had ample proof that was untrue, but contesting a tenancy branch decision isn't possible, and we don't have the means to take this to the Supreme Court.

The landlord and her family verbally and emotionally abused me and my elderly mother. The place became uninhabitable and unsafe, and we had to quickly find a place, any place, to leave. Due to the pest and mold exposure, my mother's lungs were severely impacted with interstitial lung disease (hypersensitivity pneumonitis). She had a flare up again in 2023, and she is now in pallative care, severely disabled, on oxygen 24/7 and living in torment. We never got our deposit back either, and the tenancy branch threw out our case because the landlord used fake tenancy agreements signed by her relatives (who lied under oath in the hearings and said they were strangers) to prove that we had filed our arbitration/case thing past the due date. ;",
